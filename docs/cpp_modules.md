# C++ Modules

FraudShield utilizes optimized C++ modules for efficient data cleaning and feature engineering. These modules are designed to handle large datasets and perform computationally intensive tasks with high performance.

## Data Cleaning Module

The data cleaning module is responsible for handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the raw transaction data. It performs the following tasks:

1. **Missing Value Handling**: The module identifies missing values in the dataset and applies appropriate imputation techniques, such as mean imputation or KNN imputation, based on the characteristics of the data.

2. **Outlier Detection and Removal**: The module detects outliers using statistical methods like Z-score or Interquartile Range (IQR) and removes or replaces them with suitable values to prevent bias in the subsequent analysis.

3. **Data Normalization**: The module normalizes the numeric features to a common scale (e.g., 0 to 1) to ensure fair comparison and prevent any single feature from dominating the others.

The data cleaning module is implemented using C++ to leverage its performance advantages and low-level control over memory management. The module utilizes efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize runtime and memory overhead.

## Feature Engineering Module

The feature engineering module is responsible for extracting relevant features from the cleaned transaction data. It performs the following tasks:

1. **Aggregation Features**: The module calculates aggregated features, such as total transaction amount, average transaction amount, and transaction frequency, over different time windows (e.g., past 30 days, past 90 days) to capture historical patterns.

2. **Temporal Features**: The module extracts temporal features, such as time since last transaction and time of day, to identify unusual transaction timings or patterns.

3. **Behavioral Features**: The module derives behavioral features, such as the ratio of high-value transactions to total transactions and the percentage of transactions in different categories, to capture user-specific patterns.

4. **Contextual Features**: The module incorporates contextual information, such as user demographics and transaction location, to provide additional insights into fraudulent behavior.

The feature engineering module is implemented using C++ to ensure fast computation and efficient memory utilization. It leverages parallel processing techniques, such as OpenMP or Intel TBB, to accelerate feature extraction on multi-core systems.

## Integration and Usage

The C++ modules are integrated into the FraudShield pipeline through Python bindings. The Python code interacts with the C++ modules using a well-defined API, passing the necessary data and receiving the cleaned and engineered features in return.

To use the C++ modules in the FraudShield pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Compile the C++ modules using a compatible C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang) with the required flags and optimizations.

2. Create Python bindings for the C++ modules using tools like pybind11 or Boost.Python to enable seamless interaction between Python and C++.

3. Import the Python bindings in the relevant scripts and call the appropriate functions to perform data cleaning and feature engineering.

4. Pass the cleaned and engineered features to the machine learning models for training and prediction.

The C++ modules in FraudShield are thoroughly tested using unit tests and integration tests to ensure their correctness and reliability. They are optimized for performance and can handle large-scale datasets efficiently.

By leveraging the power of C++ for data cleaning and feature engineering, FraudShield achieves significant performance improvements and enables faster processing of large volumes of transaction data.
