# FraudShield: Anomaly Detection Pipeline

## Overview
FraudShield is an advanced anomaly detection pipeline designed to identify and prevent fraudulent activities within large datasets. By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques, efficient C++ data processing modules, and a robust SQL-based data storage and retrieval system, FraudShield ensures the integrity and security of financial transactions.

## Key Features
- Ingestion of large-scale transaction data from various sources
- Efficient data cleaning and preprocessing using optimized C++ modules
- Advanced feature engineering techniques to extract relevant fraud indicators
- Training and evaluation of state-of-the-art machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
- Comprehensive model evaluation using multiple metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC)
- Seamless integration with SQL databases for data storage and retrieval
- Modular and scalable architecture for easy maintenance and extension
- Robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms for real-time fraud detection
- User-friendly interfaces for data exploration, model training, and results interpretation

## Architecture
The FraudShield pipeline consists of the following key components:
1. Data Ingestion: Collects transaction data from various sources and stores it in a centralized SQL database.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Applies advanced data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features from the preprocessed data to capture patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent behavior.
4. Model Training and Evaluation: Trains machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) on the engineered features and evaluates their performance using cross-validation and hold-out datasets.
5. Model Deployment: Deploys the trained models in a production environment for real-time fraud detection and prevention.
6. Monitoring and Alerting: Continuously monitors the performance of the deployed models and triggers alerts for suspicious activities.

## Getting Started
To get started with FraudShield, follow these steps:
1. Clone the FraudShield repository: `git clone https://github.com/muditbhargava66/FraudShield.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up the SQL database and update the configuration files with the appropriate connection details.
4. Preprocess and engineer the features using the provided C++ modules.
5. Train and evaluate the machine learning models using the `model_training` and `model_evaluation` scripts.
6. Deploy the trained models in a production environment and configure the monitoring and alerting mechanisms.
7. Start detecting and preventing fraudulent activities in real-time!
