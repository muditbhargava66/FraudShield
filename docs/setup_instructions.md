# Setup Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the FraudShield anomaly detection pipeline on your local machine or a production environment.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the setup, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- C++ compiler (GCC or Clang)
- SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Apache Airflow
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the FraudShield repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/muditbhargava66/FraudShield.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd FraudShield
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment for the project:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For Unix or Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Compile the C++ modules:
   ```
   cd src/data_cleaning
   g++ -O3 -o data_cleaning data_cleaning.cpp
   cd ../feature_engineering
   g++ -O3 -o feature_engineering feature_engineering.cpp
   ```

7. Set up the SQL database:
   - Create a new database for FraudShield.
   - Update the database connection details in the configuration file (`conf/database.ini`).
   - Run the SQL scripts in the `src/sql` directory to create the required tables and indexes.

8. Configure Apache Airflow:
   - Set up Airflow by following the official documentation: [Apache Airflow Documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html)
   - Update the Airflow configuration file (`airflow.cfg`) with the required settings, such as the executor, database connection, and scheduler interval.
   - Initialize the Airflow database:
     ```
     airflow db init
     ```
   - Create an Airflow admin user:
     ```
     airflow users create --username admin --password admin --firstname Admin --lastname User --role Admin --email admin@example.com
     ```

## Configuration

1. Update the configuration files in the `conf` directory:
   - `conf/database.ini`: Set the database connection details.
   - `conf/airflow.cfg`: Configure Airflow settings, such as the executor and scheduler interval.
   - `conf/pipeline.yaml`: Specify the pipeline parameters, such as input data paths, model hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics.

2. Modify the SQL queries in the `src/sql` directory, if necessary, to match your specific database schema and requirements.

## Running the Pipeline

1. Start the Airflow webserver and scheduler:
   ```
   airflow webserver --port 8080
   airflow scheduler
   ```

2. Access the Airflow web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

3. Enable the FraudShield DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in the Airflow web interface.

4. Trigger the DAG manually or wait for the scheduled run according to the configured schedule interval.

5. Monitor the pipeline execution in the Airflow web interface and check the logs for any errors or issues.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during the setup or execution of the pipeline, refer to the log files generated by Airflow and the individual components of the pipeline.

- Check the configuration files to ensure that all the required settings are correctly specified.

- Verify that the necessary dependencies and libraries are installed correctly.

- If you face any database-related issues, double-check the database connection details and ensure that the SQL scripts have been executed successfully.

- For Airflow-related problems, consult the Apache Airflow documentation and community forums for guidance and solutions.
